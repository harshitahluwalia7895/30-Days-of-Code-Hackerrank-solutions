    "# Python – The new generation Language\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Python designed by Guido van Rossum at CWI has become a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Knowledge of any programming language can be a plus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason for increasing popularity**\n",
    "* Emphasis on code readability, **shorter codes**, ease of writing\n",
    "* Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such as C++ or Java.\n",
    "* Python supports **multiple** programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.\n",
    "* There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.\n",
    "* Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LANGUAGE FEATURES\n",
    "  **1.Interpreted**\n",
    "* There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.\n",
    "* Directly runthe program from the source code.\n",
    "* Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.\n",
    "* No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "**2.Platform Independent**\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.\n",
    "* Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.\n",
    "* Free and Open Source; Redistributable<br>\n",
    "<br>**3.High-level Language**<br><br>\n",
    "* In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.\n",
    "<br><br>**4.Simple**<br><br>\n",
    "* Closer to English language;Easy to Learn\n",
    "* More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax\n",
    "<br><br>**5.Embeddable**<br><br>\n",
    "* Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.\n",
    "<br><br>**6.Robust:**<br><br>\n",
    "* Exceptional handling features\n",
    "* Memory management techniques in built\n",
    "<br><br>**7.Rich Library Support**<br><br>\n",
    "* The Python Standard Library is vary vast.\n",
    "* Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python ;It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.\n",
    "* Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library."
